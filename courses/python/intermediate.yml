      This tutorial is designed for people who have done some python before.

      Before you continue here is a list of things you should know:
      - The `print` command
      - Variables
      - Basic conditionals (`if`, `else` and `elif` - short for `else if`)
      - Lists (defining them and appending to them)
      - While loops
      - For loops (e.g. `for value in list:`)

      If you think you need to recap any of these there is a tutorial
      [here](../introduction/index.html) that should help you. Also it might be useful to
      have it open in another tab so you can refer to it if you get stuck.
  - subtitle: Setting up your environment
    content: |
      In previous tutorials I recommended using an IDE (integrated learning environment)
      for python, but for these tutorials we are going to get a little bit more advanced.

      The exact steps are slightly different between linux, mac and windows,
      but overall things should be pretty similar.

      ## Installing python

      **Even if you have already installed python** we may need to reinstall it to make
      sure everything is setup correctly.

      First let's check the current installation.

      If you are on windows open `command prompt`, if you are on linux or mac
      open `terminal`. I may refer to `command prompt` on windows as a `terminal`.

      Type `python3 --version` (and then hit enter) into your terminal. If there is an error, we need to
      (re-)install python.

      Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and grab the latest version of python3
      for your operating system.

      **Important:** if you are on windows make sure you check `Add Python 3.X to PATH`!

      Now type `python3 --version` (and then hit enter) into your terminal and it should work, if it doesn't
      ask for help.

      ## Setting up your editor

      There are loads of text editors we can use to write python.
      Here are two that I recommend:
      - [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
      - [Atom](https://atom.io/)

      If you have issues using them then you should look up your questions on a search
      engine, e.g. you might want to search `how to save a file using atom`.

      Now we should create a folder to store our files, perhaps call it `python_intermediate`
      (It will probably help to **not** include a space in the name).

      Now we need to navigate to the folder within our terminal.

      ### Mac / Linux
      In your terminal type `cd ` (don't hit enter yet, also include the space).

      Now in your file manager (`finder` on mac) navigate to the folder that you created.

      Drag and drop the folder onto your terminal. It should fill in the path to the folder.
      If it does this you can hit enter and you should be navigated to the folder.
      If this doesn't work you should ask for help.

      ### Windows
      On windows ... TODO
  - subtitle: Functions
    content: |
      Functions are an incredibly useful tool in programming.

      They let us *label* a block of code so that we can run it by referring to its label
      (called the function *name*).

      The `function body` is a term meaning the code that is inside the function.

      `Calling` a function is another way of saying *running the function*.
      In python we call a function by writing the function name and then some
      parentheses `()` (brackets), e.g. `function_name()`.

      Lets look at an example:
      ```python
      # The name of this function is `say_hello`
      def say_hello():
        print("Hello")
        # This is the french way of saying hello
        print("Bonjour")

      # This code isn't indented so it isn't part of the function body
      print("Hi")

      # Here we call the function
      say_hello()

      print("Some other code")

      # We can call the function as many times as we want
      say_hello()
      say_hello()
      say_hello()
      ```

      **Copy and run this code** and you will see that `hello` and `bonjour` is
      printed `4` times since we call the function four times.

      ## Function arguments

      Functions can also take in variables (called `arguments` or `parameters`).

      When we call a function with arguments we must pass in values. We do this
      by putting them in the parentheses e.g. `say_hello("Sam")`.

      ```python
      # Define a function called `say_hello` which takes in a variable called name
      def say_hello(name):
        print("Hello " + name)

      say_hello("Sam")
      say_hello("dog")
      ```

      This prints out `Hello Sam` and then `Hello dog`.

      **Tip:** whenever you want to *debug* a function it is useful to imagine replacing
      the arguments of the function with real values such as `Sam` or `Dog` and then
      run through the function in your head to see what it does.

      ## Function return

      Functions can return a value, which is useful for calculating things which
      we can return to the caller of the function.

      ```python
      def add(a, b):
        return a + b

      # Here we take the return value of 2+3 and assign it to the variable result
      result = add(2, 3)
      print(result)

      # We can add strings together too
      print(add("one", "two"))

      # If you uncomment the next line and run it you will get an error (remember we need to convert numbers to strings to join them)
      # print(add(42, " is the answer."))
      ```

      ## Challenge 1

      We're going to make a calculator using our knowledge of functions and conditionals (`if` statements).

      1. Create a function that accepts three values `operator`, `a`, `b`.
      2. Check if the operator is `+` (plus), `-` (minus), `*` (times) or `/` (divide).
      3. For each of the four cases that the operator could be, return the result of `a OPERATOR b` like a calculator.

      Let's say the function you create is called `calculate` here are some examples of what should happen:
      ```python
      # Should print 5 (since 2+3)
      print(calculate('+', 2, 3))

      # Should print 11 (since 13-2)
      print(calculate('-', 13, 2))

      # Should print 2 (since 5/2)
      print(calculate('/', 10, 5))

      # Should print 40 (since 5/2)
      print(calculate('*', 2, 20))
      ```

      ### Solution to challenge 1

      If you finish then you can take a look at the solution to compare how you did it
      to how I did it. [Here is it](assets/calculator_1.py).

      ## Challenge 2

      Once you get challenge 1 working adapt it so that a program asks you to enter
      an operator, one number and then another number and it prints the result using your calculation function.

      This program should keep asking and returning the result forever by using
      a `while True:` loop, but at the end of each calculation it should ask
      the user if they want to stop or not. If the user wants to stop use the `break`
      command to exit the loop.

      Extensions:
      - If the user enters an invalid operator tell them they must enter a valid operator and go back to the start of the loop
      (**Hint:** use a `continue` statement which skips to the next iteration of the while loop.
      You'll also probably want to use `and` between the conditions for the `if` statement).
      - Print out the full calculation and the result in the format `a OPERATOR b = RESULT`.
      So if I enter `+` as the operator, `2` for a and `5` for b, the program should print `2 + 5 = 7`.

      **Watch out:** don't forget to use the `int` function to convert the user input
      into a number.

      ### Solution to challenge 2

      If you finish then you can take a look at the solution to compare how you did it
      to how I did it. [Here is it](assets/calculator_2.py).


  - subtitle: For loops with range
    content: |
      Previously we learnt about using for loops with a pre-defined list, e.g:
      ```python
      numbers = [4, 2, 8]

      for number in numbers:
        print(number)
      ```
      It should print the numbers `4`, `2` and `8` on individual lines.

      Now we're going to learn about a really useful function called `range(start, stop)`.
      What is just is `generate` values from the `start` up to, but not including, the `stop`.

      In for loops it acts just like an list, but unlike a list which has all the values stored,
      `generators` such as `range` only produce values as they are needed.

      This means you can't do many of the things you can normally do with a
      list (e.g. index - get a value at a position).

      ```python
      # The variable name i is commonly used as a counter
      for i in range(2, 10):
        print(i)
      ```
