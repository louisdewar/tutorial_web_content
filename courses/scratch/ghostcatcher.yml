      Feel free to experiment with the other tools, but don't make it too crowded just yet! 
      You can come back later and improve the background, or select a completely new one.

  - subtitle: Drawing Pacman
    content: |
      Let's draw our pacman!

      First of all delete the "Cat" sprite by clicking on the bin icon with an "X"

      ![](assets/delete_cat_sprite.png)

      Now create a new sprite by hovering the mouse on the little cat head with a "+" sign and clicking on the paintbrush symbol

      ![](assets/paint_new_sprite.png)

      Select yellow from the color picker, the "circle" tool and draw a circle roughtly in the middle of the checkered board

      ![](assets/draw_a_circle.png)

      Let's draw the eye and the mouth! To make it easier to work, click on the magnifying glass at the bottom right of the drawing area

      ![](assets/zoom_buttons.png)

      Click on an empty spot of the drawing area to deselect pacman.

      Now select "black" as the fill colour to draw the eye.

      Notice that if Pacman is still selected, when you change the colour you change the colour of Pacman!

      ![](assets/deselect_pacman.png)

      Using the "circle" tool draw the eye

      ![](assets/draw_pacman_eye.png)

      Using the "line" tool draw Pacman's mouth closed

      ![](assets/draw_pacman_mouth_closed.png)

      Now let's draw Pacman's mouth open. First let's duplicate the drawing so that we can later create a nice animation!

      ![](assets/duplicate_pacman_costume.png)

      Notice that now Pacman has two costumes: "costume1" and "costume2". Make sure "costume2" is selected now

      Now let's "erase" a bit of Pacman to make his mouth open.

      Select the "eraser" tool and adjust its size, for example start with 20.

      ![](assets/eraser_size.png)

      Drag the white circle in order to remove a triangular shaped portion of Pacman's mouth.

      ![](assets/pacman_open_mouth.png)

      If you're not satisfied, you can always undo and try again by pressing the "Undo" button:

      ![](assets/undo_redo.png)

      Once you're happy with the result, click on the two costumes in sequence, and notice how Pacman seems to opena and close its mouth!
