      This course follows on from [intoduction to HTML](../introduction_html/index.html)
      so make sure you check that out first.

      Create a folder called `website` and create a file called `my-first-website.html`
      inside it.

      Copy this starter code into the file:
      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
      </html>
      ```

      Now create a title tag with the message `My first website`
      (don't forget that `<title>` must go in the `<head>` section).

      Then create a large header (`<h1>`) with the message `Welcome to my website`.
