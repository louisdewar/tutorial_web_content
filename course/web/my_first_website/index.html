<p>Create a folder called <code>about_me</code> and create a file called <code>index.html</code>
inside it.</p>
<p><strong>Index</strong> is a special name that means &quot;this is the main/home page&quot;.</p>
<p>Copy this starter code into the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now create a title tag with the message <code>My website about me</code>
(don't forget that <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> must go in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section).</p>
<p>Then create a large header (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) with the message <code>About me</code>.</p>

<p>The goal for this course is to create a website about you and your interests.</p>
<p>This course will encourage you to be creative and so the instructions
might ask you to come up with your own ideas.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">2. Adding content to your front page</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Create a paragraph using the <code>p</code> tag below your header (the <code>h1</code> tag).</p>
<p>In it introduce yourself, say what your name is and your age.
You could also add something about what your hobbies are.</p>

<h3>Now we're going to learn about lists.</h3>
<p>There are two types of lists, unordered lists (<code>ul</code>) and ordered lists (<code>ol</code>).
Ordered lists automatically label each item with a number whereas unordered list
just use bullet points.</p>
<p>Inside a <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> block we use the tag <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> to mark out <code>List Items</code>.</p>
<p>See the result of this code in the image below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;This is an unordered list:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another list item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is an ordered list:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/lists.png" alt="list types" /></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your task is to create an <strong>unordered</strong> list, to list anything you want.
For example you could create a section that has some of the books you have read
recently or games you have played.</p>
<p>Then once you have created that list create an <strong>ordered</strong> list ranking
something you are interested in. For example it could rank your favourite
TV shows or movies.</p>
<p>Try to make your website look structured so create headers (e.g. <code>h2</code>)
before your lists to label them, just like I've done in the example above.</p>
<p>As an extension add some images to your lists (if you need a recap then go
to the <a href="../introduction_html/index.html">intoduction to HTML</a> course).</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">3. Styling your website</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Black and white websites were all the rage when the internet first started
but nowadays every website has a least some splash of colour!</p>
<p>To do this we use a language called <code>CSS</code>. HTML and CSS work hand in hand.
HTML defines the structure of the website and CSS says how it should look.</p>
<p>CSS files have the <code>.css</code> extension just like HTML files have a <code>.html</code>
extension. A single CSS file can be shared between multiple html files.</p>
<p>Create a file called <code>styles.css</code> in the same folder as your HTML file.</p>
<p>In the <code>head</code> section of your html add the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All this does is import a CSS stylesheet called <code>styles.css</code>.</p>
<p>In <code>styles.css</code> add the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
  color: red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should make all <code>h1</code> tags red.</p>
<p>Reload your website and see if it works (make sure you have a <code>h1</code>).
If it isn't working ask for help.</p>
<p>In the next few sections we'll be learning more about CSS.</p>

    <article class="tutorial " data-index="4">
  <h2 class="subtitle">4. Selectors</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Now we've got CSS working let's backtrack and understand how CSS works.</p>
<p>Whenever we want to style something in CSS we need to describe <em>what</em>
we want to style. To do this we use something called <strong>selectors</strong>.</p>
<p>In the example code above we styled <code>h1</code> tags. We did this by using a <code>h1</code>
selector. Then we set the <strong>property</strong> called <code>color</code> to be <code>red</code>.</p>
<p>The basic structure of css is this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/css_structure.png" alt="css structure" /></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To check your understanding add some CSS that makes your ordered list (<code>ol</code>)
that you created earlier have blue text.</p>
<p>As an <strong>extension</strong> set the background color of <code>body</code> to be red. To do this you need
to use the property called <code>background-color</code>. The image above should help
you do this.</p>
<p>Once you've got this to work, feel free to change the colours to suit you.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> you can use the pre-defined named colours like <code>blue</code> and <code>yellow</code>
or you could use a <strong>hex</strong> colour. For example if I write: <code>color: #a74343;</code>
the text is a pale red. You can find more by searching for hex colours online.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Currently we only know how to target specific tags, but what if we
want more control than that? Let's say we want to target a certain group of <code>p</code>
tags but not all of them.</p>
<p>Well we need to use a class. Let's imagine we want some paragraphs to have a
large font size. We could use create a class called <code>large</code>
and then apply that class to the paragraph elements we want to be large.
To do this we use a <code>class</code> attribute on the HTML tags we want to have the class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p class=&quot;large&quot;&gt;This should be large&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won't be large&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;large&quot;&gt;This should also be large&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so we've labeled two paragaphs with the class <code>large</code> but we haven't
defined what <code>large</code> means. We need to do this in CSS. To specify a class
selector we use a dot (<code>.</code>) and then the class name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.large {
  font-size: 40px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As long as that CSS is imported any paragraph with the class large with have
a large font size.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your task is to create a class called <code>important</code> which makes the text stand out.</p>
<p>You can decide what you want to do, but I'd recommend changing the text colour,
increasing the font size, making it bold and maybe changing the background colour.</p>
<p>I haven't told you how to make text bold so you'll have to look that up. (hint:
search <code>css bold text</code>).</p>
<p>Make sure you add a paragraph to your HTML with that class.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">5. Extra CSS tricks</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>There are loads of things you can do with CSS and it would take too long
to go through all of it but here is a list of some things you might want to look
into.</p>
<p>There are no tasks for this section but you should read through it and maybe
add them to your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements can have more than one class. For example I can give a paragraph
the class <code>large</code> and the class <code>important</code>: <code>&lt;p class=&quot;large important&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
Essentially you just need to put a space in between each class.</li>
<li>You can write comments in CSS using <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> for example <code>/* This is a comment */</code>.
Everything inside the comment is ignored. This lets you write notes to your self.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced selectors</h2>
<p>Selectors can get a bit complicated but they're also really powerful.</p>
<p><code>.class-1.class-2.class-3</code> targets elements with classes
<code>class-1</code>, <code>class-2</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>class-3</code>.</p>
<p><code>.class-1, .class-2</code> targets elements with either the class <code>class-1</code>
or <code>class-2</code>. The comma <code>,</code> lets you define a list of selectors.</p>
<p><code>.class-1 .class-2</code> targets elements with the class <code>class-2</code> that are
<strong>descendants</strong> of <code>class-1</code>.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">6. Time to follow your own path</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>So far I've been giving you specific instructions on what to do.</p>
<p>This has been important for learning the basics but now you're ready
to start following your own path. I'll give you some ideas on things
you can add to your website but ultimately <strong>it's your website</strong>.
You should customise it for exactly what you want!</p>
<p>You should get rid of anything I've told you to add but you don't want.</p>
<p>As you add more features you might have an idea but get stuck trying to
implement it. <strong>Follow these steps to resolve your problems:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Search for the problem your having online. There are loads of online
resources that can help you with using HTML/CSS to create a website
(loads is underselling it, seriously the web is <strong>huge</strong>).</li>
<li>If you're following this tutorial at a coding workshop then try
asking your peers around you.</li>
<li>If you're still stuck ask a mentor (they'll be happy to help!).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>So if you haven't quite got a creative spark yet about what to do next
for you website, try some of these ideas. Feel free (in fact <strong>I encourage you</strong>)
to remix these depending on what you think is best:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add more pages: Using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags you can create links to multiple HTML files
in your website. You should create links from your lists to pages talking about the things
they describe. For example if you created a top 10 list about your favourite
games you should pick your favourite game and create a page all about it!</li>
<li>Add more CSS: now you know the basics you should be able to look things up
and make your website look awesome!</li>
<li>Add more images: It will make your website stand out.</li>
<li>Make a website about the projects you've worked on. You could create a
projects page that has links to other HTML files, each one describing a project
your worked on. You could add images.</li>
</ol>
