  <h2 class="subtitle">1. Getting started</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>To get started coding python you'll need to setup an editor where you can type and run python.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are learning using python3 (python2 is now outdated).</p>
<p>Choose one of these methods</p>
<h2>Online (fastest)</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get going with python is using an online editor such as
<a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">repl</a>.</p>
<h2>IDLE (best)</h2>
<p>Setting up the IDLE is also relatively easy and it has the advantage
that the python files are on your computer.</p>
<p>You can download python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the website</a>
(you want python3).
Once you have it downloaded you need to look for a program called IDLE.</p>
<p>Create a new file like below:
<img src="assets/idle_new_file.png" alt="IDLE new file" /></p>
<h2>Terminal (advanced)</h2>
<p>If you are a bit more advanced you might want to use the terminal or command prompt
to run python.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download python 3</a>,
if you are on windows make sure you select &quot;Add python to PATH&quot;.</p>
<p>Create a folder where you will put your code.</p>
<p>In either terminal or command prompt (depending on your OS) use the command <code>cd</code> to change
to the directory where python. To run the code use the command <code>python3 {NAME_OF_FILE}</code>
(where  <code>{NAME_OF_FILE}</code> is the name of your python file).</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">2. Hello World</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Whenever we learn a new programming language normally the first thing
we learn how to do is to say <code>hello world</code>.</p>
<p>In python we would use the <code>print</code> command to say things e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Text that you want to print out&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<ol>
<li>Change the print command to say <code>Hello world</code></li>
<li>Run it and check that it outputs what you expect</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The quotation marks around the text are important! They
tell python that we want it to treat it as text instead of code</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">3. Comments</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Sometime when we program we want to leave comments to ourselves explaining
what the code does.</p>
<p>In python anything after a <code>#</code> is ignored</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># This isn't valid python code yet it doesn't matter because of the hashtag
print(&quot;Actual python code&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Remove the hashtag from the code above and see what happens</p>
</div>

    <article class="tutorial" data-index="4">
  <h2 class="subtitle">4. Variables</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>If we want to store data we use something called variables.
They are incredibly important in coding and we'll be using many more in the future.</p>
<p>Each variable has a name and data associated with it.</p>
<p><strong>Copy and run this code</strong> and see what happens:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The name `my_variable` can be anything as long as they are no spaces and doesn't begin with numbers
my_variable = 10
print(my_variable)

# The quotation marks here are important, see what happens when you delete them
my_name = &quot;{ENTER_YOUR_NAME}&quot;
print(&quot;Hello&quot; + my_name)

# Pick your favourite number
my_favourite_number = 7
# The str() is VERY important read below for details
print(&quot;Your favourite number is &quot; + str(my_favourite_number))
</code></pre>
<h2>Interesting information</h2>
<p>On the line that said:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Your favourite number is &quot; + str(my_favourite_number))
</code></pre>
<p>We had to use a function called <code>str()</code>. <strong>Try deleting str()</strong> and see what happens.
It should say: <code>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not &quot;int&quot;) to str</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially what that means is that we can only append strings to strings.
A <strong>string</strong> is another word for text.</p>
<p><code>my_favourite_number</code> is a number (called an <code>int</code> or integer) so we need
to convert it to a string. That's what the <code>str</code> function does.</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>Create a variable called <code>my_age</code> and set it equal to your age.
Then make a print statement say <code>Your age is {YOUR_AGE}</code> (where <code>{YOUR_AGE}</code> is the variable).</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">5. Input</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>So far our programs have been a bit limited. Now we are going to learn how
to make our programs interactive.</p>
<p>Try running this program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = input(&quot;Enter your name&quot;)
print(&quot;Hello &quot; + name)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Create a program that asks a user for their favourite colour and then
prints <code>{THEIR_COLOUR} is my favourite colour too!</code> (replace
<code>{THEIR_COLOUR}</code> with the colour they pick).</p>
