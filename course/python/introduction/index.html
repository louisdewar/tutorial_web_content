  <h2 class="subtitle">1. Introduction</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>This course is intended to help teach you some basic python skills.</p>
<p>It is intended for people who have never done python before, or people
who want to brush up on their basic python skills.</p>
<p>For some of the more complicated tasks there are code solutions, but
<strong>only use these if you are done</strong> or if you are really stuck (it's probably better
to ask for help instead of looking at the answer though).</p>
<p>Some of the challenges will be tough and you will probably find it
frustrating at times but that is how you learn! They've been designed to be
difficult to try and get you to think.</p>
<p>If you <strong>read everything carefully</strong> and ask for help with things that
make you confused you should be fine.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">2. Getting started</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>To get started coding python you'll need to setup an editor where you can type and run python.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We are learning using python3 (python2 is now outdated).</p>
<p>Choose one of these methods:</p>
<h2>1. IDLE (best)</h2>
<p>Setting up the IDLE is relatively easy and it has the advantage
that the python files are on your computer.</p>
<p>You can download python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the website</a>
(you want python3).
Once you have it downloaded you need to look for a program called IDLE.</p>
<p>Create a new file like below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/idle_new_file.png" alt="IDLE new file" /></p>
<h2>2. Online (fastest)</h2>
<p>The fastest way to get going with python is using an online editor such as
<a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3">repl</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Terminal (advanced)</h2>
<p>If you are a bit more advanced you might want to use the terminal or command prompt
to run python.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download python 3</a>,
if you are on windows make sure you select &quot;Add python to PATH&quot;.</p>
<p>Create a folder where you will put your code.</p>
<p>In either terminal or command prompt (depending on your OS) use the command <code>cd</code> to change
to the directory where python. To run the code use the command <code>python3 {NAME_OF_FILE}</code>
(where  <code>{NAME_OF_FILE}</code> is the name of your python file).</p>
</div>

    <article class="tutorial hide" data-index="3">
  <h2 class="subtitle">3. Hello World</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Whenever we learn a new programming language normally the first thing
we do is to say <code>hello world</code>.</p>
<p>In python we would use the <code>print</code> command to say things e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Text that you want to print out&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>IDLE help</h2>
<p>If you are using the IDLE then in order to run the file you must go to
<code>Run -&gt; Run Module F5</code>.</p>
<p><img src="assets/idle_run.png" alt="IDLE run module" /></p>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<ol>
<li>Change the print command to say <code>Hello world</code></li>
<li>Run it and check that it outputs what you expect</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The quotation marks around the text are important! They
tell python that we want it to treat it as text instead of code.</p>
</div>

    <article class="tutorial hide" data-index="4">
  <h2 class="subtitle">4. Comments</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Sometimes when we program we want to leave comments to ourselves explaining
what the code does.</p>
<p>In python anything after a <code>#</code> is ignored</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># This isn't valid python code but it doesn't matter because of the hashtag
print(&quot;Actual python code&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Remove the hashtag from the code above and see what happens (hint: you should
get a syntax error).</p>
<p>This is what happens on the <strong>IDLE</strong> when you try to run the program without the hashtag:</p>

    <article class="tutorial hide" data-index="5">
  <h2 class="subtitle">5. Variables</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>If we want to store data we use something called variables.
They are incredibly important in coding and we'll be using many more in the future.</p>
<p>Each variable has a name and data associated with it.</p>
<p><strong>Copy and run this code</strong> and see what happens:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># The name `my_variable` can be anything as long as they are no spaces and doesn't begin with numbers
my_variable = 10
print(my_variable)

# The quotation marks here are important, see what happens when you delete them
my_name = &quot;{ENTER_YOUR_NAME}&quot;
print(&quot;Hello&quot; + my_name)

# Pick your favourite number
my_favourite_number = 7
# The str() is VERY important read below for details
print(&quot;Your favourite number is &quot; + str(my_favourite_number))
</code></pre>
<h2>Interesting information</h2>
<p>On the line that said:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Your favourite number is &quot; + str(my_favourite_number))
</code></pre>
<p>We had to use a function called <code>str(...)</code>. <strong>Try deleting <code>str(...)</code></strong> and
see what happens (leave <code>my_favourite_number</code>).</p>
<p>It should say: <code>TypeError: can only concatenate str (not &quot;int&quot;) to str</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially what that means is that we can only join strings to strings.
A <strong>string</strong> is another word for text.</p>
<p><code>my_favourite_number</code> is a number (called an <code>int</code> or integer) so we need
to convert it to a string. That's what the <code>str</code> function does.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Create a variable called <code>my_age</code> and set it equal to your age.
Then make a print statement say <code>Your age is {YOUR_AGE}</code> (where <code>{YOUR_AGE}</code> is the variable).</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>

    <article class="tutorial hide" data-index="6">
  <h2 class="subtitle">6. Input</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>So far our programs have been a bit limited. Now we are going to learn how
to make our programs interactive.</p>
<p>We're going to use a new function called <code>input</code> which asks the user a question.
We pass in a string to input which is the message that is printed to the user
before they enter their response (i.e. <code>input(&quot;SOME_MESSAGE&quot;)</code>).</p>
<p>Try running this program: (it should ask you for your name, just type it in
and then hit enter)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">name = input(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;)
print(&quot;Hello &quot; + name)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<p>Create a program that asks a user for their favourite colour and then
prints <code>{THEIR_COLOUR} is my favourite colour too!</code> (replace
<code>{THEIR_COLOUR}</code> with the colour they pick - <strong>use a variable</strong>).</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>If we look at the example we have put a space at the end of the input string
<code>&quot;Enter your name: &quot;</code>, why is that? <em>Is it important?</em></p>
<p>Also why is there a space in the print statement <code>&quot;Hello &quot; + name</code>? Is this important?</p>
<p><strong>Before you read on</strong>, play around running the example code with and without the spaces
and try to think about those two questions.</p>
<p>So the answer: For the input it just creates a nice bit of space after the question
otherwise the text the user enters will be directly after the <code>:</code>. This is
just aesthetic (aesthetic means how something looks as opposed to how something works)
and it doesn't really affect much about how the code runs.</p>
<p>We have a space in the print for a similar reason: otherwise &quot;Hello&quot; and name would
be right next to each other with no space.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">7. Lists</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>Lists allow us to store a group of items in one variable.</p>
<p>To get started we need to learn some <strong>terminology</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each item in a list is called an <code>element</code>.</li>
<li>In most programming languages (including python) we start counting from 0
so the first element of the list is at <em>index</em> (aka position) 0, and the second is at position 1 and so on...</li>
</ul>
<p>Read through the code (including the comments) and then ry running this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Create a list with the elements 1, 2 and 3
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

# Prints out the entire list (you should see &quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot; in your console)
print(numbers)

# Print the first element on the list (you should see &quot;1&quot; in your console)
print(numbers[0])

# Add a new number to the list
numbers.append(20)
# Now we should see &quot;[1, 2, 3, 20]&quot; in the console
print(numbers)

# Change the thrid number to be 42
numbers[2] = 42
# Now we should see &quot;[1, 2, 42, 20]&quot; in the console
print(numbers)

# We can remove elements by value
numbers.remove(42)
# Now we should see &quot;[1, 2, 20]&quot; in the console
print(numbers)

# We can also remove elements by their index (aka position)
# Here we delete the first element
del numbers[0]
# Now we should see &quot;[2, 20]&quot; in the console
print(numbers)

# We can also find the length of a list using the len function (at this point it should be 2)
print(len(numbers))
</code></pre>
<h2>Task</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create an empty list called <code>shopping_list</code></li>
<li>Add several items (at least 5) to this list e.g. <code>milk</code>, <code>eggs</code></li>
<li>Print the list</li>
<li>Pick two elements and remove them using <code>shopping_list.remove(...)</code></li>
<li>Print the list again (now that the items have been removed)</li>

  <h2 class="subtitle">8. Conditionals</h2>
  <div class="content"><p><code>if</code> statments are how we make decisions in our code, in general they are
called conditionals.</p>
<p>In general they follow this pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if EXPRESSION_1:
  # If EXPRESSION_1 is true do this:
  do(this)
elif EXPRESSION_2: # elif is short for &quot;else if&quot;
  # If EXPRESSION_1 is false AND EXPRESSION_2 is true then do this:
  do(something_else)
else:
  # If EXPRESSION_1 AND EXPRESSION_2 are both false do this:
  do(something_else_entirely)
</code></pre>
<p>Try running the example below and run it multiple times so you can see
both messages (run once with 'blue' and once with another colour):</p>
<p><strong>Watch out:</strong> After the <code>:</code> at the end of the line you must indent your
code (hit the tab key, or your editor may do it automatically).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">colour = input(&quot;What is your favourite colour? &quot;)

if colour == 'blue':
  print(&quot;That's my favourite colour too!&quot;)
else:
  print(colour + &quot; isn't my favourite colour, blue is!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Try it</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose a secret number between 1 and 99.</li>
<li>Ask the user to guess what the secret number is.</li>
<li>If the user guesses the correct secret number then say they're in the secret area of your program.</li>
<li>If their guess is less than the secret number (Hint: <code>if their_guess &lt; secret_number:</code>)
then tell them to pick a higher number next time</li>
<li>If their guess is higher than the secret number then tell them to pick a lower
number next time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Watch out:</strong> Remember when we had to use <code>str</code> to convert the number to a string to print it out?
Well, when we read the guess from the input we need to convert it to a number.
To do that we use the <code>int</code> function (e.g. <code>int(input(&quot;...&quot;))</code>).</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">9. Loops (i)</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>For this tutorial and the next two we're going to be improving the guessing game code
from the last tutorial so make sure you have a working copy of it
(save it and create a new file for the rest of the tasks).</p>
<p>We're first going to learn about while loops.</p>
<p>They follow the pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">while EXPRESSION:
  # Keep running the code in the while loop as long as EXPRESSION is true
  do(something)
</code></pre>
<p><code>EXPRESSION</code> is just a placeholder for some condition we might have such as
in the <code>if</code> statements, e.g. <code>while colour != &quot;red&quot;:</code> which will run again
and again as long as the variable <code>colour</code> is not <code>&quot;red&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2>Indentation</h2>
<p>Again like the <code>if</code> statements the indentation is important as it indicates what is within
the while loop.</p>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Set the initial value of colour so that it is defined
colour = &quot;&quot;
while colour != &quot;red&quot;:
  # This line is indented so it is part of the while loop
  colour = input(&quot;Choose the correct colour: &quot;)

# Since this line isn't indented it isn't in the while loop
print(&quot;You guessed the correct colour&quot;)

# This line is indented when it shouldn't be
# This will cause a syntax error
  print(&quot;This causes an error&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Delete the last print</strong> that causes the error and <strong>then run the code</strong>.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Now that you understand while loops, we're going to improve our guessing game code from earlier.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a while loop to your guessing game code so that it will keep on running until you guess correctly</li>
<li>If their guess is less than the secret number then tell them to pick a higher number</li>
<li>If their guess is more than the secret number then tell them to pick a lower number</li>
<li>Once they guess correctly tell them they are correct (hint: have this after the end of the while loop)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: set their guess to be 0 before the start of the while loop
otherwise you'll get an error saying that it isn't defined.</p>
<p>Get a friend to play the game and see if they can guess your secret number!</p>

    <article class="tutorial hide" data-index="10">
  <h2 class="subtitle">10. Loops (ii)</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>We're going to adapt the code from last time to only allow 3 guesses. This is
going to be quite tricky since your going to have to work this out yourself
but you'll get some hints.</p>
<p>You'll need to create a counter variable to keep track of the number of guesses e.g.
<code>guess_counter = 0</code>.</p>
<p>At the end of the while loop you'll want to add one to the counter <strong>each time</strong>
<code>guess_counter = guess_counter + 1</code>.</p>
<p>You'll need to add a check in the while loop to check if the maximum guesses have been reached.
To do this you'll need to write (after you increase the <code>guess_counter</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if guess_counter == 3:
  break
</code></pre>
<p><code>break</code> exits the while loop early.</p>
<p>Right now there are two conditions for whether we exit the while loop either:</p>
<ol>
<li>We guessed correctly</li>
<li>or we reached the maximum number of guesses</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to check which one happened, so we should add an <code>if</code> statement to check
if the guess was correct (and print the message saying they guessed correctly).
We should then add an <code>else</code> statement which means that they reached the maximum number of guesses
so we should print <code>You have reached your maximum number of guesses!</code></p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">11. Randomness</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>So far our guessing game has been a bit boring for us since we know the answer
already since we have to type it in ourselves.</p>
<p>What if we could get python to choose a random number?</p>
<p>Well we can, but first we need to learn about <code>import</code>.</p>
<p>There are loads of python features that are only accessible by using <code>import</code>.
Python uses <code>import</code> because it reduces clutter (mess) so our code
is clearer without getting confused with unfamiliar features.</p>
<p>When we <code>import</code> something we bring it into <em>scope</em> so we can use it.</p>
<p>To generate random numbers we need to import a module called <code>random</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random
</code></pre>
<p>Next we need to work out what function from <code>random</code> to use. To do this we
can look at the real documentation for this module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If we scroll down on this page we find this definition:</p>
<p><img src="assets/randint_doc.png" alt="randint documentation" /></p>
<p>This wording is a bit confusing but essentially it means that we pass in two
numbers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and the function returns a number which is between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
inclusive (inclusive means that the number is not only between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> but
it could also be <code>a</code> or <code>b</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import random

random.randint(a, b)
</code></pre>
<h2>Task</h2>
<ol>
<li>Change your <code>secret_number</code> in the guessing game to be a randomly generated
number between 1 and 99 (inclusive) using <code>randint</code>.</li>
<li>If the user runs out of guesses tell them what the number was.</li>
<li>Come up with a scoring system so that if the user guesses correctly they
get 100 points and then if they don't get it give them a score based on how close
they were to the actual number.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> when we calculate the points we are probably going to do some sort
of subtraction to give us the distance from the correct answer. Unfortunately
depending on whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer the distance
may be negative or positive. To fix this we use a function called <code>abs(x)</code>
which takes in a value and if it's negative then it makes it positive.</p>
<p>If you get this working we should have a pretty good guessing game!</p>
<p>Try changing the number of allowed guesses and see if you can come up with any good strategies for winning.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">12. For loops and lists</h2>
  <div class="content"><p>A <code>for</code> loop is another kind of loop but it is designed to be very easy to
loop over lists.</p>
<p>Try running this example (<code>iteration</code> means one cycle of a loop):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">example_list = [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]

# Word gets set to be the next element of the list each iteration of the loop
for word in example_list:
  print(word)
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example where we <em>sum</em> the elements in the list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [5, 2, 10, 4]

count = 0

for number in numbers:
  # count += number is a shorthand for count = count + number
  count += number

# Prints 21
print(count)
</code></pre>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>We're going to improve our shopping list from earlier to make it more dynamic
(<strong>hint:</strong> it may be useful to look at the list section for help using lists).</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a while loop ask to user to keep on entering items into a shopping list until they type <code>STOP</code></li>
<li>Using a for loop print all the elements of the list</li>
</ol>
<p>Hint: If you're unsure how to write the loop which ends where the user types <code>STOP</code>
you could write the while loop using <code>while True:</code> (which means it runs forever)
and then use and <code>if</code> statment and a <code>break</code> statement to exit when the user types <code>STOP</code>
(there are other methods if you can think of them).</p>
<h2>Optional Bonus</h2>
<p>Add some more features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the user enters the items into the list have another loop that
lets the user delete items until they type <code>STOP</code>.</li>
<li>When the items are printed out also print the number next to it (e.g. <code>1. milk</code>, <code>2. eggs</code> ...).
You'll need a counter to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask people around you what they think would be useful for a shopping list
or think of improvements yourself and then code it!</p>
